## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the project:

1. **Do not disclose it publicly.**
2. **Report it privately** to the maintainers via email:  
   📧 **info@vyrazu.com**
3. Include the following details (if possible):
   - A clear description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept.
   - The affected version or component.
   - Any potential impact or severity assessment.

We’ll acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**, investigate promptly, and keep you informed throughout the process.

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:
- Give us reasonable time (usually **7–14 days**) to investigate and deploy a fix.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what’s necessary for proof of concept.
- Do not share the issue with third parties or post it publicly before a fix is released.
- Respect user data privacy and integrity during testing.

In return, we pledge to:
- Acknowledge your contribution if desired (in release notes or security credits).
- Not pursue legal action for good-faith reports.
- Provide transparency on the mitigation steps and timeline.

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Developers

All developers and contributors must adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Credentials & Secrets
- Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or access tokens.
- Use environment variables or secure vault services.
- Immediately rotate any leaked or compromised credentials.

### 2. Data Protection
- Handle sensitive data (e.g., user info, asset metadata) according to data protection principles.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
- Avoid storing unnecessary personal data.

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Enforce role-based access controls.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Implement session expiration and token invalidation where applicable.

### 4. Dependency Management
- Keep all dependencies up to date.
- Use trusted package sources (e.g., PyPI, npm registry).
- Regularly run security scanners (e.g., `pip-audit`, `npm audit`) to identify vulnerabilities.

### 5. Code Review
- Review all pull requests for security implications.
- Verify that sensitive operations include proper authorization checks.
- Avoid using unsafe functions or unverified third-party scripts.

## 🧪 Reporting Security Incidents

In case of a security incident (such as data breach, unauthorized access, or malware injection):
1. Immediately notify the maintainers at **info@vyrazu.com**
2. Document:
   - Date/time of discovery.
   - Impacted systems or data.
   - Any actions taken.
3. Avoid making public statements until an official disclosure is made.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Compliance
- Follow all relevant data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) where applicable.
